How To Add New Sounds
=====================

To add a new sound set, follow these three steps:

1. Make a copy of the example directory and rename it.
2. Add your sound files into that directory
3. Adding the sound file names to the soundconf.json file


The important thing is to have the sound files and the soundconf.json file in the same directory.

You can also supply soundset directories on a USB pendrive.
